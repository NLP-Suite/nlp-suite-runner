The NLP Suite Runner is a binary that automatically installs 3 main packages:

- NLP Suite UI: the user interface to interact with the NLP Suite Agent
- NLP Suite Agent: the core algorithms and tools provided by the NLP Suite
- Stanford CoreNLP: a dependency needed to run the NLP Suite

**The NLP Suite Runner requires to download and install** [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

### Mac

Mac and Linux systems can easily extract `.tar.gz` files without additional tools.

#### M-Chip Series

If you have a mac running the ARM M-chip series, ensure that you install the `darwin-arm64` version of the NLP Suite Runner.

#### Intel Chip Series

If you have the Intel chip, you will need to install the `darwin-amd64` version of the NLP Suite Runner.

### Windows

To extract the runner, you will need [7-zip](https://www.7-zip.org/), a file archiver tool for Windows.

You most likely will need to install the `windows-amd64` version of the NLP Suite Runner.
If your device has an ARM chip, ensure you have `windows-arm64` installed. To check which version you have, check [here](https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/176966-how-check-if-processor-32-bit-64-bit-arm-windows-10-a.html).

To start the runner, follow [these instructions to allow the NLP Suite Runner to open.](https://www.macworld.com/article/672947/how-to-open-a-mac-app-from-an-unidentified-developer.html#:~:text=Open%20System%20Settings.-,Go%20to%20Privacy%20%26%20Security.,Click%20the%20Open%20Anyway%20button.)

### Windows / Linux Systems

There are no known issues for starting and running the NLP Suite Runner at this time.

### Input / Output Directories
Currently, the input and output directories are hard coded. DO NOT TRY ALTER THE INPUT AND OUTPUT PATHS.

For Mac users, the folder is located in your home folder. The home folder may not directly appear in your Finder. To convinently add your home folder to Finder, use these [instructions](https://www.tomsguide.com/how-to/how-to-find-the-home-folder-on-mac-and-add-it-to-finder).

**Make sure that the files are uploaded individually into the input directory and not inside of another folder.**

### Updating the NLP Suite Runner

While the NLP Suite Runner automatically updates the installed packages mentioned above, the NLP Suite Runner does not automatically update itself.
Periodically check this page to ensure you have the latest version installed.
